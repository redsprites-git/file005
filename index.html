			<h2>The Moon</h2>

			<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, roughly 1/6th our gravity and 1/4th our size. It's tidally locked, always showing the same face to us. Formed around 4.5 billion years ago, the Moon influences ocean tides and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt.</p>

			<h2>Orange Moon</h2>

			<p>An orange or reddish Moon usually appears when it’s low on the horizon. This happens because the Moon’s light passes through a thicker layer of Earth’s atmosphere, which scatters shorter blue wavelengths and allows longer red and orange wavelengths to reach your eyes—similar to how sunsets look red.</p>

			<h2>Red Moon / Blood Moon</h2>

			<p>A red Moon, often called a “Blood Moon,” occurs during a total lunar eclipse. The Earth moves between the Sun and the Moon, blocking direct sunlight. However, some sunlight still reaches the Moon after being filtered and bent through Earth’s atmosphere. This light is rich in red wavelengths, giving the eclipsed Moon a deep red or coppery glow.</p>

			<h2>Blue Moon</h2>

			<p>Though rare, a Moon can actually appear blue—not just in name. This happens when there are particles in the atmosphere of just the right size, such as after a large volcanic eruption or major wildfire. These particles scatter red light and allow blue light to pass through, tinting the Moon blue. It's a real but unusual phenomenon.</p>
